# coupons
In this project, our objective is to find optimal value for coupon and how many customers to send coupons to.

- Define a cut-off date for churn
- Classify customers who haven't bought anything after cut-off date as churned customers
- Calculate order times and transaction values for every customers
- Define a "score" to find best churned customers
- Identifying best churned customers according to score
- Calculating number of customers who can use coupon
